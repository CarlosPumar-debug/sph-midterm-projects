<h1>The Assignment</h1>
<p>I‚Äôm teaching an R Programming course next term. Jessica Minnier and I are developing the Ready for R Materials into a longer, more involved course.</p>
<p>I think one of the most important things is to teach people how to self-learn. So that‚Äôs the motivation behind the <em>Tidyverse function of the Week</em> assignment.</p>
<p>I asked on Twitter:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">
Hi Everyone. I'm teaching an <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#rstats</a> course next quarter. <br><br>One assignment is to have each student write about a <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/tidyverse?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#tidyverse</a> function. What it's for and an example.<br><br>What are some less known <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/tidyverse?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#tidyverse</a> functions that do a job you find useful?

<p>This was an unexpectedly really fun thread, and lots of recommendations from others.</p>
<p>I thought I would try and summarize everyone‚Äôs suggestions and compile a list of recommended functions. I used <a href="https://github.com/gmellini/twitter-scraper">this script</a> with some modifications to pull all the replies to my tweet. In particular, I had to request for <code>extended</code> tweet mode, and I extracted a few more fields from the returned JSON.</p>
<p>This wrote the tweet information into a CSV file.</p>
<p>Then I started parsing the data. I wrote a couple of functions, <code>remove_users_from_text()</code> and <code>get_funcs()</code> to try and clean the data a bit, and used a relatively simple regular expression to try to return the function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>remove_users_from_text &lt;- function(col){
  str_replace_all(col, &quot;\\@\\w*&quot;, &quot;&quot;)
  
}

get_funcs &lt;- function(col){
  out &lt;- str_extract_all(col, &quot;\\w*\\(\\)|\\w*_\\w*&quot;)
  paste(out[[1]], collapse=&quot;, &quot;)  
}

parsed_tweets &lt;- tweets %&gt;%
  rowwise() %&gt;%
  mutate(text = remove_users_from_text(text)) %&gt;%
  mutate(funcs = get_funcs(text)) %&gt;%
  ungroup() %&gt;%
  separate_rows(funcs, sep=&quot;, &quot;) %&gt;%
  select(date, user, funcs, text, reply, parent_thread) %&gt;%
  distinct()

write_csv(parsed_tweets, file = &quot;cleaned_tweets_incomplete.csv&quot;)

<p>At this point, I realized that I just needed to hand annotate the rest of the tweets, rather than wasting my time trying to parse the rest of the cases. So I pulled everything into Excel and just annotated the ones which I couldn‚Äôt pull from.</p>

<h2>Functions by frequency</h2>
<p>Here are the function suggestions by frequency. Unsurprisingly, <code>case_when()</code> (which I cover in the main course), has the most number of suggestions, because it‚Äôs so useful. <code>tidyr::pivot_wider()</code> and <code>tidyr::pivot_longer()</code> are also covered in the course.</p>
<p>There are some others which were new to me, and a bit of a surprise, such as <code>coalesce()</code>, <code>fill()</code>.</p>
